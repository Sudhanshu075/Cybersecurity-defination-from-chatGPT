Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice or technique to keep data safe from unauthorized access by using encryption and decryption.

CIA:
CIA triad is a cybersecurity model focused on three key principles:

Set up firewall:
Change default usernames and passwords.
Disable DHCP if it’s not needed.
Enable logging for troubleshooting and monitoring.
Disable remote administration on the root account.
Identify and understand your network and assets.
Define clear security policies and rules.
Perform a risk assessment.

Secure Server Setup:
Change default usernames and passwords.
Keep the server OS and software updated.\
Disable unnecessary services and ports.
Enable logging and monitoring.
Use strong firewall rules to control traffic.
Disable remote admin for root or default accounts.
Implement regular backups.
Use encryption for sensitive data.
Set proper file permissions.
Limit user access based on roles (least privilege).

SSL vs TLS:
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):
A now-obsolete cryptographic protocol that was used to secure data transmitted between a client and a server over the internet by encrypting the communication.
TLS (Transport Layer Security):
A modern and secure cryptographic protocol that replaced SSL, used to protect data in transit by encrypting and authenticating communication over networks — commonly used in HTTPS, email, and VPNs.

| Feature                | **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**  | **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**             | Deprecated (no longer used)     | Actively used (TLS 1.2 and 1.3)                         |
| **Security**           | Weak, vulnerable to attacks     | Strong encryption and improved security                 |
| **Speed**              | Slower handshake and encryption | Faster, more efficient                                  |
| **Supported Versions** | SSL 2.0, 3.0 (all insecure)     | TLS 1.0, 1.1 (deprecated), 1.2, 1.3                     |
| **Usage Today**        | Not used in modern systems      | Used in HTTPS, email, VPNs, and more                    |
| **Handshake Process**  | Older, less secure methods      | Uses stronger algorithms, supports modern cipher suites |
