Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice or technique to keep data safe from unauthorized access by using encryption and decryption.

CIA:
CIA triad is a cybersecurity model focused on three key principles:

Set up firewall:
Change default usernames and passwords.
Add MFA
Disable DHCP if it‚Äôs not needed.
Enable logging for troubleshooting and monitoring.
Disable remote administration on the root account.
Identify and understand your network and assets.
Define clear security policies and rules.
Perform a risk assessment.

Secure Server Setup:
Change default usernames and passwords.
Add MFA
Keep the server OS and software updated.\
Disable unnecessary services and ports.
Enable logging and monitoring.
Use strong firewall rules to control traffic.
Disable remote admin for root or default accounts.
Implement regular backups.
Use encryption for sensitive data.
Set proper file permissions.
Limit user access based on roles (least privilege).

SSL vs TLS:
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):
A now-obsolete cryptographic protocol that was used to secure data transmitted between a client and a server over the internet by encrypting the communication.
TLS (Transport Layer Security):
A modern and secure cryptographic protocol that replaced SSL, used to protect data in transit by encrypting and authenticating communication over networks ‚Äî commonly used in HTTPS, email, and VPNs.

| Feature                | **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**  | **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**             | Deprecated (no longer used)     | Actively used (TLS 1.2 and 1.3)                         |

| **Phishing**                             | - Fake emails or messages<br>  trick users into revealing sensitive data. | - User training<br>- Email filtering<br>- Don‚Äôt click suspicious links             |
| **Ransomware**                           | - Malware that encrypts files<br>  and demands ransom to unlock them.     | - Backups<br>- Antivirus<br>- Don‚Äôt download unknown attachments                   |
| **Malware**                              | - Malicious software that harms<br>  or spies on your system.             | - Use antivirus<br>- Keep software updated<br>- Avoid pirated software             |
| **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** | - Overwhelms a server with traffic<br>  to make it crash.                 | - Use CDN or DDoS protection service<br>- Firewall rules<br>- Traffic monitoring   |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**             | - Attacker intercepts data<br>  between two parties.                      | - Use HTTPS/TLS<br>- VPN<br>- Avoid public Wi-Fi without protection                |
| **SQL Injection**                        | - Injecting malicious SQL code<br>  into forms or URLs.                   | - Use input validation<br>- Parameterized queries<br>- Web application firewall    |

port scanning:
Port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports and services running on a computer or network. It helps attackers or security testers discover which doors (ports) are open and what programs (services) are listening behind them.

| **Vulnerability** | A weakness or flaw in your system that could be exploited.             | An unpatched software bug or open port.                                              |
| **Risk**          | The **potential impact** of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.       | If a hacker (threat) exploits a weak password (vulnerability), data may leak (risk). |
